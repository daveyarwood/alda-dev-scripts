       (comment
         "In these tests, we are acting like a worker process interacting with
          the server we are testing.

          The backend receives two different types of messages from workers:
          - responses to forward to the client that made the request
          - heartbeats

          It is difficult to test the first type of message, because the server
          takes it and forwards it to the client, and does not send anything back
          to the worker to let us know that this happened.

          The frontend tests above actually confirm that this works properly; if
          the server has at least one worker running, then if you send a message
          to the frontend and the server sends a response from the worker, then
          we know that the first type of message works.

          Testing the second type of message here. As a worker, if we send an
          AVAILABLE heartbeat to the server, it should start sending us HEARTBEAT
          signals.")
